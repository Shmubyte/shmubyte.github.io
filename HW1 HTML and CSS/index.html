                <li>Public Law 107-56, The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, 
                    or more commonly known as the USA Patriot Act, was signed into law on October 26th, 2001 by President George W. Bush following the 9/11 
                    terrorist attacks. The act was passed to bolster national security by expanding the powers of law enforcement agencies like the Federal 
                    Bureau of Investigation and National Security Agency in order to deter and prevent terrorist acts on U.S. soil. It allows these government 
                    agencies to conduct investigations without issuing traditional warrants to people or organizations if they are suspected of terrorist activity. 
                    This allows the agencies to apply for a collection of, “any tangible things… for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or 
                    clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of 
                    activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution” (US Congress, 2001, p. 17). This includes your phone, banking, location, 
                    and social media data, as well as data that is less defined. Unless you are properly prepared, you are currently being monitored by your government 
                    and companies alike.</li> <br>
