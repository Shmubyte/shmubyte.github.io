        <h2>Interests</h2>   
        <ul>
            <li><span class="firstWord">Learning:</span> I enjoy the act of learning and find it hard to focus on other things after getting the ball rolling.</li>
            <li><span class="firstWord">Sport:</span> Basketball is my favorite sport as it is one of the most technically challenging. It has a steep learning curve which allows for mastery and skill expression. For me, this mostly translates to cross-overs that are practiced enough to be called "ankle-breakers".</li>
            <li><span class="firstWord">Videogame:</span> Deadlock, the game on Steam (not to be confused with the resource sharing concept), is occupying a lot of my time lately for similar reasons to basketball. It's a mobile-online-battle-arena game where you queue up for virtual pick up games with random people to engage in competitions of skill and luck.</li>
            <li><span class="firstWord">Music:</span> I used to produce songs around 4 years ago, but now I mostly just curate my own playlists, and scour the internet for new/interesting music. I hope to resume the journey of music production shortly after getting good enough at computer science to ensure that I will not be a starving artist (but then again, having money in the bank isn't so important when making music that people can enjoy). </li>
