            <p>If you were to earn 1 dollar every second of everyday, it would take you approximately 11 days and 13 hours to become a millionaire. 
            However, to become a billionaire, it would take you approximately 31 years and 8 months. Peter Thiel is a surveillance entrepreneur who 
            has acquired 2.7 billion dollars of U.S. tax-payer dollars through defense contracting. 1.3 billion comes directly from the pentagon.
            Thiel is ushering in the era of surveillance capitalism. Currently his technologies have been adopted by ICE to track, and monitor people without
            U.S. citizenship so that they may be identified and deported. The IDF also uses Thiel's technologies.</p>

            <p>Ellison's technology is utilized by the National Security Agency(NSA) to spy on American citizens. The NSA has been amassing American data and even passing around captured nude photos around their office, as reported by Edward Snowden. Ellison's media company, Skydance recently merged with Paramount. He and his family control CBS news, and are aiming to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery which CNN is a part of. He wants to unify all the national data and then let AI analyze it.
                He is contributing to the propaganda machine that works hand in hand with surveillance capitalism to normalize the incoming onslaught of privacy rights abuses. Ellison is quoted as saying, "Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on." </p>
